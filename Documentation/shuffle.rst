Example

To run the example project, clone the repo and run the ``ShuffleExample`` target.

###########
Basic Usage
###########

1. Create your own card by subclassing SwipeCard. The card below displays an image, can be swiped left or right, and has overlay views for both directions:

.. sourcecode:: swift 

   class SampleCard: SwipeCard {
   override var swipeDirections {
      return [.left, .right]
   }
   
   init(image: UIImage) {
        content = UIImageView(image: image)
        leftOverlay = UIView()
        rightOverlay = UIView()
        
        leftoverlay.backgroundColor = .green
        rightOverlay.backgroundColor = .red
   }
 } 



  
2. Initialize your card data and place a ``SwipeCardStack`` on your view:

.. code-block:: swift

    class ViewController: UIViewController {
    let cardStack = SwipeCardStack()
    
    let cardImages = [
        UIImage(named: "cardImage1"),
        UIImage(named: "cardImage2"),
        UIImage(named: "cardImage3")
    ]
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        view.addSubview(cardStack)
        cardStack.frame = view.safeAreaLayoutGuide
                              .bounds.insetBy(dx: 10, dy: 50)
        }
    }


3. Conform your class to the ``SwipeCardStackDataSource`` protocol and set your card stack's ``dataSource``:

.. code-block:: swift
  func numberOfCards(in cardStack: SwipeCardStack) -> Int {
   return cardImages.count
}

func cardStack(_ cardStack: SwipeCardStack, cardForIndexAt index: Int) -> SwipeCard {
   return SampleCard(image: cardImages[index])
}
    


4. Conform to the ``SwipeCardStackDelegate`` protocol to subscribe to any of the following events:

.. sourcecode:: swift 

 func didSwipeAllCards(_ cardStack: SwipeCardStack)
 func cardStack(_ cardStack: SwipeCardStack, didSwipeCardAt index: Int, with direction: SwipeDirection)
 func cardStack(_ cardStack: SwipeCardStack, didUndoCardAt index: Int, from direction: SwipeDirection)
 func cardStack(_ cardStack: SwipeCardStack, didSelectCardAt index: Int)

Note: ``didSwipeCardAt`` and ``didSwipeAllCards`` are called regardless if a card is swiped programmatically or by the user.


============
Card Actions
============

The following methods are available on ``SwipeCardStack``.

*****
Swipe
*****

Performs a swipe programmatically in the given direction.

.. sourcecode:: swift

    func swipe(_ direction: SwipeDirection, animated: Bool)

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mac-gallagher/Shuffle/master/Images/swipe.gif

.. sourcecode:: swift
   func swipe(_ direction: SwipeDirection, animated: Bool)

****
Undo
****
Restores the card stack to its state before the last swipe.

.. sourcecode:: swift

 func undoLastSwipe(animated: Bool)

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mac-gallagher/Shuffle/master/Images/undo.gif


*****
Shift
*****

Shifts the card stack's cards by the given distance. Any swiped cards are skipped over.

.. sourcecode:: swift
  
 func shift(withDistance distance: Int = 1, animated: Bool)

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mac-gallagher/Shuffle/master/Images/shift.gif
